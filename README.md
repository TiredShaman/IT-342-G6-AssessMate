# AssessMate - Review and Assessment System
## PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
### 
AssessMate is a review and assessment system designed for review centers to enhance the learning experience through structured quizzes and performance tracking. The platform provides two main user roles: coaches and reviewees, each with distinct functionalities to facilitate effective exam preparation.
Coaches have full control over the learning process, allowing them to create and manage classes, ensuring organized batch enrollments. They can also create, edit, and delete quizzes, tailoring assessments to match specific subject requirements. Additionally, coaches can access reviewees' progress, enabling them to track performance, identify areas for improvement, and provide targeted guidance.

On the other hand, reviewees can actively participate in their learning journey through self-enrollment using a unique code provided by their coach. They can take quizzes with the option to set a time limit, simulating real exam conditions. The system offers progress tracking, allowing reviewees to monitor their performance over time. After completing quizzes, reviewees can review their results to analyze mistakes and understand correct answers. Additionally, they have the opportunity to retake quizzes, reinforcing learning and improving their knowledge retention.

Assess Mate provides an interactive and structured approach to exam preparation, making it an essential tool for review centers to optimize student learning outcomes.
