NAME: ANTOINETTE R. RUBIO
COURSE & YEAR: BSIT-3

I am a proud student of CITU and I'm already at my third year in BSIT. I am from the southern part of Cebu, Bantayan Island. I was born in August 2001 and that make me a snake and a leo girly. Playing volleyball is one of my favourite thing to do and of course spending time with my cats. I can say that I am an observant person but I can also stop observing someone after cutting them of. charrizzz
